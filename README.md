## Features
* Put Milestones into different timelines, which can then be organized into one or more groups.
* Visualize Milestones by scrolling through an indefinite timeline view. The timelines scope can be changed for a better overview.
* Track and visualize delays.

## Please Note
Milestones is a little side project of mine and _very much_ "Work In Progess". Even though I use it for my own project management duties it still has quite a few bugs and issues. So, use at your own risk! Feedback and code contributions are welcome :)
